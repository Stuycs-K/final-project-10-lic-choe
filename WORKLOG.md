## ELIEZER CHO

### 5/23/23

created the Tiles class, I will make the 2 extensions of the class after. (buyable and unbuyable)

made the buyable and unbuyable classes, I have to test it with the player class later

### 5/24/23
started to transfer things over to processing, need to add map and make it show up on processing


### 5/25/23
started making map, it shows up on processing. will work on making more stuff to the map.

### 5/26/23
started adding prices to map, but there were way too many errors. have to fix these later today/tomorrow.

### 5/27/23
made change to gmaemechanics.pde, map.pde, player.pde because it caused errors and i had to fix them. I also didn't know how to change the map in an efficient way, so i just brute forced it.

### 5/30/23
I made methods to display the stats of the players, like showing their current balance, their last roll, name, and list of properties

### 5/31/23
I made it so that the rolling dice things actually works, and displays on the side. Each person has different last rolls, and i forgot about that yesterday so i had to fix.

###6/1/23
I made it so that my game finally displays teh characters, i jsut brute forced it and will need to make it better.
