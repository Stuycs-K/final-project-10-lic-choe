### 5/26/23
started adding prices to map, but there were way too many errors. have to fix these later today/tomorrow.

### 5/27/23
made change to gmaemechanics.pde, map.pde, player.pde because it caused errors and i had to fix them. I also didn't know how to change the map in an efficient way, so i just brute forced it.

### 5/30/23
I made methods to display the stats of the players, like showing their current balance, their last roll, name, and list of properties

### 5/31/23
I made it so that the rolling dice things actually works, and displays on the side. Each person has different last rolls, and i forgot about that yesterday so i had to fix.
