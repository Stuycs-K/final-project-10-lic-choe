## Overview
We will be recreating the hit board game “Monopoly” using Processing; the user can play against another player. There will be a button to click for rolling the dice, and the turn alternates for each player. The two players can choose avatars from different TV shows. There will be a banking system that keeps track of how much money we have, and whoever goes bankrupt loses. Finally, the different nuances of the game, such as community chest and chance cards, and being able to mortgage are things we have implemented into our project.
## Instructions
You will be greeted with a menu, where you can either start a game, read the rules, or choose your avatar by clicking on one of the pages.
Controls:
'Enter' to roll
'b' to buy current tile, if applicable
'm' and click to sell a tile, if applicable ('c' to cancel)
